# KenyanAI-Navigation

## Project Overview

Google Maps users in Kenya often face persistent navigation challenges marked by confusing directions, inconvenient detours, and unpredictable arrival times. These issues are primarily attributed to limitations in existing navigation solutions, particularly in contending with complex factors affecting GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) positioning accuracy in the Kenyan context. This challenge goes beyond technical constraints and impacts the precision of location data, affecting the overall navigation experience.

This repository addresses these challenges and presents a practical solution through the power of AI/ML. Our vision is to create a navigation experience finely tuned for Kenyan users, guided by machine learning algorithms. Your contribution in this exploration is pivotal in producing better positions and connecting geo-spatial information with improved granularity, ultimately shaping the future of navigation methods.

Discover how AI can transform GNSS accuracy, providing precise navigation tailored to Kenya's unique landscape. This impact extends beyond the limitations of current mobile phones, offering lane-specific directions crucial for avoiding missed exits and inaccurate arrival times. Join discussions on refining GNSS data and innovative machine learning models, envisioning a future where AI-powered navigation exceeds conventional expectations, including augmented reality walking guides.
